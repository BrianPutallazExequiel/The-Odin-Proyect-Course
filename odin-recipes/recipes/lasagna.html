  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that embodies layers of flavor and comfort. It starts with wide, flat pasta
    sheets that are cooked to perfection. Between these layers of pasta, you'll find a rich and savory filling, often
    consisting of seasoned ground meat, such as beef or pork, combined with a luscious tomato sauce, aromatic herbs, and
    spices. Interspersed with the meaty mixture are creamy and indulgent layers of béchamel sauce and grated Parmesan or
    mozzarella cheese. This delightful combination of textures and flavors is then baked to a golden, bubbling
    perfection in the oven.The result is a mouthwatering masterpiece that offers a harmonious blend of tender pasta,
    savory meat, tangy tomato sauce, and cheesy goodness. Lasagna is often garnished with fresh basil leaves or more
    cheese on top for an extra layer of flavor. Whether homemade or enjoyed at an Italian restaurant, lasagna is a
    beloved comfort food that warms the heart and satisfies the palate.</p>
